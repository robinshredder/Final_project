Technical Notes

Being able to use programming for our prototyping and design process has been vital. Since we worked with sounds, lights, vibrations and colors using code has been important in order to come to the insights and gain the knowledge that we eventually did about our chosen area. 

Our group tested how well vibration works as a way of communicating the connectivity between the Philips hue lamp and your phone. However, we realized that ”normal” vibration patterns were perceived as ”just another notification”. So in order to notice a difference when showcasing the connectivity of the Philips hue lamp and your phone the vibration pattern should be different or match our chosen notification sound and rhythm of the pulsating light coming from the lamp. Therefor, making a page where you could try different kinds of vibration patterns on your phone by pressing the buttons on the page was of relevance since it would enhance the interactive experience. Each button show a particular vibration pattern and by trying out the different ones we could decide which one best indicate connectivity and is perceived as slightly different than for example the vibration you get when you receive a text. 

The ideal scenario would have been that I could control the vibrations from either my computer or another phone, to make the ”notification” more realistic and to make it cross device. However, sending vibrations from one device to another is not available when using javascript and would only be possible using java, but since our group doesn’t have any knowledge or experience using that program we used it like I described instead which worked well since it tested what we wanted it to test. In this way of using programing it was a resource since it tested different vibration patterns and gave us further insights on ways of improving the connectivity between the Philips Hue lamp and a phone. This code was fairly simple to write, it does however not work the way that the group initially wanted it to since you can´t control the vibration patterns from another device and in this way it was a burden using code since it took time coming to that realization. The interaction became limited due to the fact that we were not able to make the vibration code cross device, it was although still a resource since it tested how different vibration patterns can enhance the connectivity signal due to the modification from a more familiar vibration notification to one matching with our chosen sound and light change. 

Furthermore, Ellen and I also made a cross device web socket page where you can change the background color from another device by crossing the boxes. We did this as a prototype so we could change the color on another device to symbolize a function for the Hue and to get more practice in programing cross device experiences. Using a cross device page for testing color change in the Hue lamp enhanced the interaction since we could control it from afar, the experience of the Hue was due to that more realistic. This made our page a resource for the design activities when we user tested the color connectivity signal.
