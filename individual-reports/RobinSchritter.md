Programming 2


We've worked with allot of different prototypes in code. Some of them have been important in our prototyping sessions whilst some felt short almost as soon as they were created. 
I still believe working with coding prototypes is a good set up. As in fairly short time you can create something which could mirror allot of features in a technical product.

We started of working with background colors and dimming lights. Most of us made some type of prototype in this genre. Some of them felt short and weren't used in the prototyping sessions. Some of them were crucial for us in our sessions where we noticed some features worked while others did not. This thanks to our programming prototypes. 

As a first prototype we had a paper built prototype above a tablet/phone which showcased our webpage controlling color. This proved to give good insight in the form of missing connectivity. One of the issues was also that the prototype did not look like a lamp. This took us to our Arduino prototype. 

We created different patterns with lights, sound and vibrations with the help of javascript. This together with a live server, websockets, helped us connect to the units in real time and could change colors depending on movement etc of the user moving and entering the rooms. We also created an Arduino LED light with a dimmer function which was coded and set up as one of our last prototypes. With our javascript controlling lights, sound and vibration we had created something tangible. Something showing connectivity in between user and unit (light, phone, tablet). A prototype actually looking like a lamp. 

The user could identify the prototype and with the help of our code the user could see the connectivity in between the unit and the user. Without our vibrations and the sound created to symbolize connectivity the prototype fell short. Something that we noticed during our user tests. The user needed some kind of  notification to understand the connectivity between the light and the user. This was showcased through using vibration and sound in the users unit (phone/tablet) together with a response from the smart light existing of sound and dimming lights. All connections showed/played in a certain to understand that the notifications was dependable on each other. 

In conclusion, the prototyping could have passed without using code. It would have been extremely difficult and taken allot more time than what it did when using code and working with the Arduino. The design process was shortened and the code really helped us in our prototyping and user test scenarios.

Programming 2


We have worked with allot of different prototypes using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Arduino programming language (which is based on C/C+). 
I believe that using programming to help building prototypes is good a practice. With the help of programming, you can create elements which could mimic allot of different features in technical products. 

Our prototypes:
Our group decided to design prototypes for smart lights and how they could show connectivity to users. 

Our prototypes consisted of two different designs, which ran through a couple of iterations and improvements. From the first week we decided to work with programming. By using WebSockets and animated color schemes we could mimic the smart lights function, changing brightness.

With the help of existing JavaScript libraries and WebSockets we could create an animated element on a webpage which worked cross platform. We also worked with sound and the Arduino micro board. By combining sound (which was played from a webpage) with the prototype (a lamp with a dimming function) we could do useful user tests and get good feedback.

Programming:
During my programming sessions I occasionally had a hard time grasping what I actually coded. Some of the code was handed to us during our course of “Programming 2” which could be reused without making too many changes to it. For example: working with WebSockets. I now understand the gist of it and had no major issues reworking the code to fit my needs. But I do not feel that I have the knowledge to create WebSockets on my own. 

I also see the benefits of using existing libraries in JavaScript. The benefit of using existing libraries is that it saves allot of time for the programmer. Instead of creating the amount of functions and line of code necessary to, for example animate an object, you can simply load an existing file which then helps you do animations by using a couple of simple lines of code. 

I have no major problem to read code. My issues are when writing my own code from scratch. I understand most of the syntax, but I am having difficulties combining all the necessary pieces to create a larger project. What goes first and what functions are needed to run all of it? (This would be when creating larger projects.)

During my Arduino experience I learnt the basics of the Arduino. We had no major experience from the Arduino to begin with. By doing my research and following tutorials I could understand and create the dimming light with the help of the Arduino board. 
I learnt the basic connections of the board. I learnt using different built in functions from the Arduino library and got the knowledge that arrays could be programmed to be used when using the Arduino board. 
With the help of programming, we could bring our physical prototypes to life. We created interactions and connectivity which else would have been harder to create. By using code when creating prototypes, we saved allot of time. Even though we most likely could have mirrored our prototype used at the time, without using programming. I think we saved both time and effort. With our programmed webpage we could run the soundboard from one computer and the Arduino smart light from another. This made us only use two people from our group as man power. With some further set up I think we could have used one person to run the prototype and others to observe. From our physical prototypes we got feedback from user tests which gave us relevant data to analyse and iterate our work.
