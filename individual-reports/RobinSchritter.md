Programming 2


We've worked with allot of different prototypes in code. Some of them have been important in our prototyping sessions whilst some felt short almost as soon as they were created. 
I still believe working with coding prototypes is a good set up. As in fairly short time you can create something which could mirror allot of features in a technical product.

We started of working with background colors and dimming lights. Most of us made some type of prototype in this genre. Some of them felt short and weren't used in the prototyping sessions. Some of them were crucial for us in our sessions where we noticed some features worked while others did not. This thanks to our programming prototypes. 

As a first prototype we had a paper built prototype above a tablet/phone which showcased our webpage controlling color. This proved to give good insight in the form of missing connectivity. One of the issues was also that the prototype did not look like a lamp. This took us to our Arduino prototype. 

We created different patterns with lights, sound and vibrations with the help of javascript. This together with a live server, websockets, helped us connect to the units in real time and could change colors depending on movement etc of the user moving and entering the rooms. We also created an Arduino LED light with a dimmer function which was coded and set up as one of our last prototypes. With our javascript controlling lights, sound and vibration we had created something tangible. Something showing connectivity in between user and unit (light, phone, tablet). A prototype actually looking like a lamp. 

The user could identify the prototype and with the help of our code the user could see the connectivity in between the unit and the user. Without our vibrations and the sound created to symbolize connectivity the prototype fell short. Something that we noticed during our user tests. The user needed some kind of  notification to understand the connectivity between the light and the user. This was showcased through using vibration and sound in the users unit (phone/tablet) together with a response from the smart light existing of sound and dimming lights. All connections showed/played in a certain to understand that the notifications was dependable on each other. 

In conclusion, the prototyping could have passed without using code. It would have been extremely difficult and taken allot more time than what it did when using code and working with the Arduino. The design process was shortened and the code really helped us in our prototyping and user test scenarios.
