<h1>Pulsating Flame</h1> 

<p>This pulsating flame sketch is a cross-device prototype. It was made in an early stage of the sessions as a way to demonstrate that the Philips Hue was a “living light”. It didn’t end up getting used as it was too hard to see it through the lamps we decided to make.</p> 

<p>To try it out by just opening the files through an npm server and you are good to go.</p>
