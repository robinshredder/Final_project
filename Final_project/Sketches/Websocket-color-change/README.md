<h1> Websocket color change </h1>

<p> This color change page is hosted on https://zonked-radish.glitch.me/, please visit the page on two devices simultaneously and see the colors change on both devices (thanks to the use of a websocket). This was made as a prototype in order to be able to change the color on another device to symbolize the function of a smart light (such as the Philips Hue) </p>
